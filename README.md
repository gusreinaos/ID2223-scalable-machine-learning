# Lab 2 - LLM Tuning and Serving

Link to the LLM: TODO

## Model Improvements

Herein we detail how we improved the base model. The model we ended up choosing for our final implementation was TODO which we supply to our UI using the TODO.gguf.

### Model-centric approach

- e.g., tune hyperparameters, change the fine-tuning model architecture, etc

### Data-centric approach

- identify new data sources that enable you to train a better model that one provided in the blog post

If you can show results of improvement, then you get the top grade.
